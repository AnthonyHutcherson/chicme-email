# CHICME email using the MJML Framework

## Description
This project is an email template that I built using the MJML email framework with it's syntax.
I wanted to add a fashion email template to my portfolio so I decided to do CHICME. This is a template I duplicated from my inbox and is responsive on all devices.
## Installation
Please download the **MJML** extension on VSCODE.
